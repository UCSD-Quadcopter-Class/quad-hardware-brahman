FLYBACK and FILTERED are connect in all your motor controllers.

Filter cap on otor controller input should 0.1uF

The schematic symbol for your mosfet is pretty poor.  The pin names are meaningless and you should use a standard transistor symobl.

The jumper should be between the positive battery terminal and VBAT, not GND.

you need to connect EN on your voltage regulator to VCC

you have now attributes set and no value on your LED resistors (R1, etc.)

missing pullups on I2C bus

Many missing connection IMU.  Read the datasheet.  It is not sufficient to just replicate the schematic in the datasheet.

Your FTDI connector has several errors.
