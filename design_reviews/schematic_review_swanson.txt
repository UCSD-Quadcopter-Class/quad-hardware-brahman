FLYBACK and FILTERED are connect in all your motor controllers.

Filter cap on otor controller input should 0.1uF

The schematic symbol for your mosfet is pretty poor.  The pin names are meaningless and you should use a standard transistor symobl.

The jumper should be between the positive battery terminal and VBAT, not GND.

you need to connect EN on your voltage regulator to VCC

you have now attributes set and no value on your LED resistors (R1, etc.)

missing pullups on I2C bus

Many missing connection IMU.  Read the datasheet.  It is not sufficient to just replicate the schematic in the datasheeut.

Your FTDI connector has several errors.



THe TX and RX lines need be swapped on your serial and FTDI

You don't need pullup resistors on the inputs to the IMU

For C26 and C24, you to use one of the existing parts in the the prebuilt library.  Or at least set the attributes correctly.

Your motor controllers are not conneted to your microcontroller.

C6, C11, C16, C14, C3, C28, C27, C2 are all decoupling caps that connect VBAT to GND.  They should go from VBAT to BAT_GND.

You are powering your IMU with VBAT.
